# Cisco Packet Tracer RIP Network Topology

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a network topology with three LANs connected using RIP (Routing Information Protocol) in Cisco Packet Tracer. Each LAN has 4 PCs connected via a switch, and the LANs communicate through routers configured with RIP.

## Configuration
Each router is configured with RIP to share routing information across LANs.

## How to Run
1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Run `ping` from any PC to test connectivity between LANs.
